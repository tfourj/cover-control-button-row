# cover-control-button-row
button row for controlling open/close covers in Home Assistant. This plugin will also accept a "cover group" as the entity_id.

This element is completely theme-able to provide a match to the other control rows to provide a consistent look for the different elements in your Lovelace frontend

Installation:

The easiest way to install this is to use the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS) in Home Assistant.

Follow the instructions there for installation making sure you note the "url:" section for the resources addition.


Conversely, if you don't use HACS you can install it manually by performing the following:

Copy the cover-control-button-row.js file to the appropriate folder in your Home Assistant Configuration directory (/config/www/).

Place the following in your "resources" section in your lovelace configuration (updating the localation to where you placed the above file):

  ```
    - url: /local/cover-control-button-row.js
      type: module
  ```
    
Then to use this in a card place the following in your entity card:
